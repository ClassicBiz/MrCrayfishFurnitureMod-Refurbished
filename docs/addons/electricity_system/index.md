# Introduction

Electricity is a new system introduced in MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod: Refurbished. It is used to provide power to appliances and other electronics, like the Computer and Stove. Blocks are connected to each other by an "invisible" network, only visible when a player is holding Wrench. Each electricity block contains a node, which can be linked to other nodes to create a connection. The connection allows for an electric current to be carried between blocks. Connections can be created, again, using a Wrench.
