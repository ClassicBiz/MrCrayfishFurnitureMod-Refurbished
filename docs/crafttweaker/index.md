# CraftTweaker

From the description of CraftTweaker
> CraftTweaker is a Minecraft mod which allows modpacks and servers to customize the game. With CraftTweaker you can change recipes, script events, add new commands and even change item properties! When used with other mods the possibilities become endless. Ranging from custom machine recipes to entirely new blocks and items!

If you've ever played a modpack, it's most likely being powered by CraftTweaker to provide a custom experience. 

## Getting Started

#### 1. Download CraftTweaker
CraftTweaker will need to be installed to take advantage of the custom integration. CraftTweaker can be downloaded from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafttweaker/files/all) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/crafttweaker/versions). Make sure you download the correct file according to your Modloader and Minecraft version, and copy the file into your `mods` directory like normal.

#### 2. Learn ZenScript
At the core of CraftTweaker is a scripting language called ZenScript. This is how you will be writing all your recipe modifications. You will need to learn the basics of writing ZenScript, which can be found at the [documentation](https://docs.blamejared.com/) of CraftTweaker. You can find many examples on their doumentation modifying vanilla recipes or you can run the command `/ct examples` in-game to dump examples into the script directory.

#### 3. Write your First Script
Check out the [tutorial script](./crafttweaker/your-first-script) for a brief guide on adding recipes with ZenScript by adding a new recipe to the Workbench!
If you are already familiar with writing custom scripts, you can skip straight to viewing all the available recipes types and their functions.
