is a new system introduced in MrCrayfish\'s Furniture Mod: Refurbished. It is used to provide power to appliances and other electronics, like the Computer and Stove. Blocks are connected to each other by an \\"invisible\\" network, only visible when a player is holding Wrench. Each electricity block contains a node, which can be linked to other nodes to create a connection. The connection allows for an electric current to be carried between blocks. Connections can be created, again, using a Wrench.","sidebar":"addonSidebar"},"addons/electricity_system/new_block/custom_implementation":{"id":"addons/electricity_system/new_block/custom_implementation","title":"Custom Implementation","description":"This option is only recommended if you need to implement the electricity system into an existing block entity class and you can\'t use one of the prebuilt classes, or you want full control of everything. Ensure you follow all the steps carefully to avoid implementing the methods and handling syncing incorrectly.","sidebar":"addonSidebar"},"addons/electricity_system/new_block/prebuilt_classes":{"id":"addons/electricity_system/new_block/prebuilt_classes","title":"Using Prebuilt Classes","description":"MrCrayfish\'s Furniture Mod: Refurbished provides many prebuilt classes that you can extend to avoid common boilerplate code. You\'ll need to decide whether you are going to create a Module or a Source. A Module is an electricity block that recieves electrical power (like the Computer), while a Source is an electricity block (like the Electricity Generator) that produces and provides electrical power to modules.","sidebar":"addonSidebar"},"addons/index":{"id":"addons/index","title":"Introduction","description":"Creating an addon requires that you have a good understanding of Java and creating Minecraft mods. The tutorials in this section will not cover basic topics like setting up development environments, and adding new items/blocks into the game. You should already understand that before proceeding.","sidebar":"addonSidebar"},"addons/tv_channels/index":{"id":"addons/tv_channels/index","title":"Getting Started","description":"","sidebar":"addonSidebar"},"crafttweaker/index":{"id":"crafttweaker/index","title":"CraftTweaker","description":"From the description of CraftTweaker","sidebar":"crafttweakerSidebar"},"crafttweaker/recipes/cutting_board_combining":{"id":"crafttweaker/recipes/cutting_board_combining","title":"Cutting Board (Combining)","description":"Combining is new system introduced in MrCrayfish\'s Furniture Mod: Refurbished. It allows the player to stack items on a Cutting Board to craft a new item. The best way to think about this recipe is creating a sandwich, you start by placing a slice of bread, then layer your ingredients, and then finalise it by placing another slice of bread on the top.","sidebar":"crafttweakerSidebar"},"crafttweaker/recipes/cutting_board_slicing":{"id":"crafttweaker/recipes/cutting_board_slicing","title":"Cutting Board (Slicing)","description":"Slicing is system in MrCrayfish\'s Furniture Mod: Refurbished that allows the player to slice an item on a Cutting Board with a Knife.

It is placed on top of a powered Stove. Items need to be flipped half way through the cooking process with a Spatula. Along with the frying pan comes the new frying pan recipe type so you can add custom recipes. The Stove that heats the Frying Pan requires electrical power in order for it to function.","sidebar":"crafttweakerSidebar"},"crafttweaker/recipes/grill_cooking":{"id":"crafttweaker/recipes/grill_cooking","title":"Grill (Cooking)","description":"The Grill is a block that allows the player to cook up two four items at a time. It is \\"powered\\" by placing charcoal into the block. Similar to the Frying Pan, half way through the cooking process, the items will need to be flipped with a Spatula. Items are cooked independantly from others.","sidebar":"crafttweakerSidebar"},"crafttweaker/recipes/microwave_heating":{"id":"crafttweaker/recipes/microwave_heating","title":"Microwave (Heating)","description":"The Microwave is a block that allows you to heat items.

It has the ability to bake up to three different items simultaneously. They are also baked independantly, so it doesn\'t matter it another item is already half way baked when you add it into the Oven.","sidebar":"crafttweakerSidebar"},"crafttweaker/recipes/recycle_bin_recycling":{"id":"crafttweaker/recipes/recycle_bin_recycling","title":"Recycle Bin (Recycling)","description":"The Recycling Bin is a pseudo uncrafter/item deleter. Uncrafting in the game using an items actual crafting recipes is overpowered. The Recycling Bin aims to provide a handcrafted experience that doesn\'t break the gameplay experience, while still providing useful items from breaking down an item. Due to it\'s handcrafted nature, a custom recipe has to be provided for the recycle bin in order to return items from breaking it down, it is not automatic. The base mod currently supports most vanilla blocks/items (that make sense) and blocks/items from the mod itself. By default, the recycling bin will consume all items regardless if their is a recycling recipe of not; this acts like a sort of item deleter for lack of better words.","sidebar":"crafttweakerSidebar"},"crafttweaker/recipes/toaster_heating":{"id":"crafttweaker/recipes/toaster_heating","title":"Toaster (Heating)","description":"The Toaster is block that allows a player to heat/cook an item.
